DAX LEARNING PART 4: CALCULATE

What CALCUATE does:

There's an outer filter context,  and CALCULATE will generate a new filter context by merging the outer filter context with the new filter context which is defined by the next argument. 


+ Modifiers: KEEPFILTERS, ALL, REMOVEFILTERS, CROSSFILTER, USERELATIONSHIP
Local modifiers - change only the way one filter is being applied;
Global modifiers - change the behaviour of CALCULATE

KEEPFILTERS: keep outer filters and add the new filter as a further one, it will show empty as there's no such data available.


CALCULATE evaluation steps:
	1. Evaluation of filter arguments;
	2. Context transition;
	3. Evaluation of CALCULATE modifiers;
	4. Application of filter arguments an KEEPFILTERS
	
	
	
***Only filter Columns not the whole Table



REMOVEFILTERS - remove all inside and outside context filters
ALLSELECTED - remove inside (e.g., table filter) but keep the outside (e.g., filters)






VALUES: restore the "Year"
