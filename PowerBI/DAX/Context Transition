DAX LEARNING PART 3: CONTEXT TRANSITION

Context transition is one of the operations that  calculate performs, and when the context transition happens, calculation transforms any existing row context into filter context.  

It is not easy to spot when the transition happens - for it to happen, you need to have a row context and you need to involve CALCULATE => trigger the context transition

Measure:
_Sales of big customers =
SUMX(
           Values(Customer[customerkey]),
           VAR _CustomerSales =
                              CALCUATE(
                                              SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Net Price])
)

VAR _Result =
            IF(_CustomerSales <= 5000, _CustomerSales)

RETURN
_Result



Context transition is when a Row Value becomes a Column Filter, it happens when you use a Measure inside an Iterator Function
